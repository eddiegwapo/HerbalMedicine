<h3>Herbal medicine (also herbalism) is the study of pharmacognosy 
    and the use of medicinal plants,
    which is the foundation of traditional medicine. 
    There is limited scientific evidence for the safety 
    and efficacy of plants used in 21st century herbalism, 
    which does not generally provide purity or dosage standards.</h3>
